Mushroom Classification with Neural Networks


# Mushroom Classification with Neural Networks

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts mushroom edibility (edible vs. poisonous) using a neural network built in **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The goal was to compare a baseline model against a PCA-preprocessed model to evaluate improvements in training efficiency and interpretability.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (PCA, preprocessing)
- TensorFlow / Keras (neural network)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

## ðŸ“‚ Data
- Source: [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)  
- Features: Cap shape, color, gill characteristics, etc.  
- Target: Edibility (edible vs. poisonous)  

## Approach
1. Cleaned and preprocessed categorical features.  
2. Built a baseline neural network classifier.  
3. Applied **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.  
4. Compared model accuracy, interpretability, and training efficiency.

## Results
- Baseline model accuracy: XX%  
- PCA model accuracy: YY%  
- PCA improved training speed by Z%.  

## Key Takeaways
- PCA can simplify models while maintaining strong performance.  
- Demonstrated ability to preprocess, build, and evaluate neural networks with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Reinforced understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques.
